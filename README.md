# Cypress-Demo-Petstore-API

This repository contains the Cypress test scripts which were used by Edwin Peters for demoing REST API testing with Cypress in the meetup group <i>TA Commun_IT</i> on the 25th of November, 2020.<br>
All test scripts in this repository are using the API's on https://petstore.swagger.io/<br>
These are API tests only.

There is one other repository containing the test scripts that were used to demo the combined testing of UI and API:<br>
https://github.com/e-peters/Cypress-Demo-Bookstore-API-UI


Use them for your own inspiration.


Have fun!
